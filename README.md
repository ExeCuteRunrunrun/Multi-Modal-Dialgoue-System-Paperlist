### Video

[AVSD - Audio Visual Scene-Aware Dataset](https://video-dialog.com/) was used in [DSTC7](http://workshop.colips.org/dstc7/) and [DSTC8](https://sites.google.com/dstc.community/dstc8/tracks) The task is to build a system that generates response sentences in a dialog about an input VIDEO. The data collection paradigm is similar to VisDial
