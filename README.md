[Visual QA](https://visualqa.org/workshop.html) VQA datasets in CVPR2021,2020,2019,..., containing open-ended questions about images. These questions require an understanding of vision, language and commonsense knowledge to answer.
- [VQA](https://visualqa.org/challenge) datasets [1.0](http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.00468) [2.0](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00837)
- [TextVQA](https://textvqa.org/paper) TextVQA requires models to read and reason about text in an image to answer questions based on them. In order to perform well on this task, models need to first detect and read text in the images. Models then need to reason about this to answer the question. 
- [TextCap](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.12462) TextCaps requires models to read and reason about text in images to generate captions about them. Specifically, models need to incorporate a new modality of text present in the images and reason over it and visual content in the image to generate image descriptions.
